## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3
This was one of the funniest labs I did because we used a lot of if statements that implemented domain logic. We also converted from integer to double and used unit tests to help guide my decisions with development. We had to find someone’s basal metabolic rate (BMR) and see the amount of energy that their body expends while resting. This was found by multiplying their weight, height, age, and calories per day.

Lab 6, part 2
This lab was my second favorite because it showed me how to score a game of Blackjack. We used command lines and if-statements for players to turn for their “hit”, “stand”, or “bust”. We used to use if-statements to tell them if they went over 21 and they automatically lost.

Lab 8, part 1
This lab was one of the funniest labs we did because we had to write a function that computes the average mean of all elements of a vector. We had to use the average algorithm as three judges chose a numerical score. We used command-line argument inputs and used loops to process values. To get the remaining scores average together we used nested loops to print patterns.
